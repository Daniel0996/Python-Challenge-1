Module 2 Challenge
This is my first Python coding assignment.

This assignment has a starter segment of code which has a nested menu dictionary with items and prices.  It also converts the menu item to 2 levels of menu displays , menu categories and items under a selected category.

The assignment tasks are
    1. Build a user input to prompt for an item selection under a selected category
    2. Validate the user selection of the menu item
    3. Prompt for a quantity of the menu selection, default to 1 if not valid
    4. Append to an order list
    5. Add code to handle user response to continue ordering or finish
    
    6. Loop through the order item in the order list
    7. Follow a fixed length table format, calculate the number of spaces to be padded to the right of dictionary field of each order item
    8. Print each order item on one line in the fixed length table.
    9. Use list comprehension to calculate the total of the order and print it.
